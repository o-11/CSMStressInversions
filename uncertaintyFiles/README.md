These files are used by the Bayesian MCMC to provide the fault geometry uncertainties and uncertainty on rake determined from the slip model.
If using new fault geometries, you will need to precompute the Jacobians for error propagation; see the precomputeJacobiansFx subdirectory for details.
While the test files are simplistic, they can serve as a template. Please reference Walbert & Hetland (2022) for more information.
