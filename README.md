### About
Inversion of coseismic slip models for tensorial pre-earthquake stress through a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimation strategy.
Please see Walbert & Hetland (2022) for a description about our non-informative priors, likelihood function and parameterization of the stress tensor that is incorporated in this code.

### Quick Start
To run the Random Walk for the example files included, run the following through terminal as:

`python runFile.py`

Following completion, run scripts described by the README in the postProcessing subdirectory.

While example input files for slip model geometries and uncertainties are available, users are encouraged to create new input files following these examples as a template for coseismic slip models of interest.
Users can modify the input files read and the length of the random walk in runFile.py.

### Feedback and Support
Please contact Olivia Walbert at ohelprin@umich.edu for questions and/or feedback.
